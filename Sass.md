# The Benefits of Sass
- **Variables**: for reusable values such as colors, font-sizes, spacing, etc...
- **Nesting**: to nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code
- **Operators**: for mathematical operations right inside of CSS
- **Partials and imports**: to write CSS in different files and importing them all into one single file
- **Mixins**: to write reusable pieces of CSS code
- **Functions**: similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can then be used
- **Extends**: to make different selectors inherit declarations that are comman to all of them
- **Control directives**: for writing complex code using conditionals and loops

The difference between Sass and SCSS is that Sass is the original version of the language and it doesn't contain curly braces for blocks and doesn't have semicolons to end lines. As this makes it a bit harder to convert existing CSS files, most people use SCSS as it has these features just like CSS.
